CHANGES IN PAPI 4.1.1 SINCE PAPI 4.1.0
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
    * resolved confusion in event table naming for Intel Core, Core2 and Core
      Duo processors; cleaned up Nehalem and Westmere event definitions.
	* the --with-no-cpu-counters function and timing functions for AIX
	  were fixed.
	* compiler flags for AIX Fortran were fixed.
	* doc directory is now preserved to prevent 'make clean' from entering an
	  ininite loop.
	* prevent passing -Wextra to libpfm build, which was throwing errors in
	  that build under certain circumstances.
	* fix a subtle problem in multiplexing in which final counter values could
	  be under-reported. Changes the behavior of PAPI_stop when multiplexing.
	  See the ChangeLog for further details.
	
Enhancements:
-------------
	* now supports attach/detach for perf_events, thanks to Gary Mohr.
	* update cache information for recent Intel x86 processors.
	* F_SETOWN_EX was implemented in perf_events to guarantee that each
	  process recieves it's own interrupts. This fixes a bug in high
	  interrupt rates reported by Rice.
	* perf_events checks permissions at configuration rather than at start.
	  Thanks to Gary Mohr.
	* Pentium IV now supported under perf_events in kernel 2.6.35
	* add a WARNING for tests cases that don't fail but have issues
	  that may need to be addressed.
	* add OS kernel version to component info struct; useful for enabling /
	  diabling features in PAPI based on kernel version
	* updated to terminal release (3.10) of libpfm.
	* mmtimer support added for Altix / perf_events.
	
New Platforms:

GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This is the second release of Component PAPI, or PAPI-C. See other references
to PAPI-C, including the description in this file under PAPI 4.0.0 for details 
on the differences between Classic PAPI and PAPI-C.

This release includes significant code cleanup to eliminate compiler warnings
and type inconsistencies and to eliminate memory leaks.

We also now support embedded doxygen comments for documentation. See the PAPI
website for more details.

The component build environment has been restructured to make it easier to add
and build components without modifying baseline PAPI code. See 
/src/components/README for details.

CHANGES IN PAPI 4.1.0 SINCE PAPI 4.0.0
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
    * configure was mis-identifying some Pentium 4 processors
    * the ctests/shlib test now tests against the shared math library, libm.so,
      instead of libpapi.so, which works more predictably with library renaming.
    * multiplexing was silently returning without setting multiplex TRUE in 
      cases where no event had been assigned to an eventset. An event must be
      added to an eventset or PAPI_assign_eventset_component() must be called
      before multiplexing can be enabled. This silent error has been removed. 
    * the perfmon and perf_events counter interfaces were not properly handling 
      event unit masks. This has been fixed.
    * PAPI_name_to_code() was not exiting properly in certain circumstances, 
      failing on events where there should have been a match. This is corrected.
    * a serious but insidious bug in the overflow logic was corrected. This bug 
      would only show up when PAPI_overflow was called between calls to 
      PAPI_add_event. Overflow would only be set for the last call of 
      PAPI_overflow. This has  been corrected.
	* IBM Blue Gene P systems were corrupting stack frames and crashing when the
	  papi_get_event_info call was executed. This has been fixed.
	* The PAPI cycles event was not working for IBM Blue Gene P. This is fixed.
	* papi_native_avail was exiting improperly when using the -e option. 
	  This caused problems with batch execution systems (like Blue Gene P). 
	  This has been fixed.
	* a significant number of memory leaks have been purged.
	* compiler warning flags have been tightened and a range of warnings have
	  been eliminated.
	* removed implicit type conversions in prototypes.
	

Enhancements:
-------------
	* the utils/papi_version utility now reports four digits where the last digit
	  matches the patch number.
	* Pentium II and Athlon now use libpfm for event decoding like all other x86
	  platforms.
	* Doxygen documentation has been added to the API and components.
	* Component compilation has been completely restructured. See
	  /papi/src/components/README for details.
	* PAPI can now be compiled with a no-cpu-counters option.
	

New Platforms:
-------------
	* the ultrasparc architecture has been resurrected
	* freebsd support was migrated from PAPI 3.7
	* Intel Nehalem EX and Westmere support has been added
	
Deprecated Platforms:
---------------------
	* IBM BG/L has been deprecated.
	* POWER 3 and POWER4 have been deprecated

New Components:
---------------
	* Infiniband: Experimental
	* Lustre: Experimental
	* example: provides simple test case and template code.

Open Issues:
-------------

Experimental:

PAPI 4.0.0 RELEASE NOTES                                            19 Jan 2010
===============================================================================

This file documents changes in recent PAPI releases in inverse chronological
order.

For details on installing PAPI on your machine, consult the INSTALL.txt file
in this directory.

For specific and detailed information on changes made in this release, grep
the ChangeLogP400.txt file for keywords of interest or go directly to the PAPI
cvs tree.


GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This is the inaugural release of Component PAPI, or PAPI-C. It represents a 
significant architectural change from PAPI 3.7.x and earlier. As such, your 
application must be recompiled and relinked to libpapi, the PAPI library for 
this version to work.
PAPI-C is backward compatible with earlier versions of PAPI. All new library 
features are supported through new APIs and all old APIs still work as expected.
Applications instrumented for PAPI should continue to work as expected with no
changes.
The major change in PAPI-C is the support of multiple components, or counting 
domains, in addition to the traditional hardware counters found in the cpu. The
goal of this first release of PAPI-C is to provide a stable technology platform
within which to explore the development and implementation of additional
components.
Although a small number of components are provided with this release, the major
objective has been to guarantee that PAPI-C works at least as well as earlier
PAPI releases and on the same range of hardware platforms. We think we have 
achieved that goal.

CHANGES IN PAPI 4.0.0 SINCE PAPI 3.7.2
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------

Enhancements:
-------------
- The perf_events linux kernel interface is supported for POWER and x86 in 
  linux kernels 2.6.31 and above.
- PAPI info now includes information on multicore heirarchy. This is reported
  in the header of many tests.

New Platforms:
-------------
- IBM Blue Gene P has been fully integrated into the code base. It still
  suffers the same quirks and limitations as the earlier pre-release.

Open Issues:
-------------
- Components are invoked from the configure line; Requires PAPI source code
  modifications to add new components.

Experimental:
-------------

Known Bugs:
-----------
- some tests involving overflow and profiling fail with linux perf_events
- multiple event overflow only works for last event enabled on (at least)
  Intel Core2 and Itanium architectures.
- clock speeds on variable speed Intel systems can be misreported, leading to 
  incorrect calculations of mflops
- memory leaks may lead to (rare) seg faults on Pentium4 systems

bad decision.


CHANGES IN PAPI 3.7.1 SINCE PAPI 3.7.0
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
- fixed long standing subtle multiplexing bug in which TIDs and PIDs would get
  confused. TIDs would then get lost leading to long term instability.
- fixed unit mask handling in perf_counters
- fixed uninitialized string issue in /proc/cpuinfo parsing
- fixed event reporting errors for various Opteron Family 10h models

Enhancements:
-------------
- FreeBSD support for Intel i7
- cleaned up libpapi.so naming for RedHat rpms
- cleaned up various other issues for rpms per RedHat
- autodetection of 2.6.31 perf_counter interface (in most cases)
- enhanced packaging options in configure to support building either static or 
  shared libraries independently

New Platforms:
-------------
- Support for the perf_counters (PCL: Performance Counters for Linux) interface
  for Linux kernel 2.6.31 and later has been more completely tested on a 
  broader range of platforms, including Opteron, Core2, i7, and POWER.
  It successfully performs basic counting operations and handles many multiplex,
  overflow and profiling situations. It is still not as extensivelytested as the
  perfmon or perfctr interfaces, but is ready for work. Caveat Emptor.

Major Issues:
-------------
- see 3.7.0

Experimental:
-------------

Known Bugs:
-----------
- see 3.7.0
